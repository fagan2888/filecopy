python file copy tool with pause button.

So , i am an ubuntu user 
Working on a file copy tool as a hobby using python and Qt.

##Features
###Implemented:
  - Pause button  indicators: current speed , average speed, estimated time, remaining size, percentage copied 
  - Made it calculate the progress by reading the size of the copied file, not the buffer size like nautilus and nemo

###Not Implemented:
  - Drag and drop
  - Copying Directories , and queueing files
  - saving progress log on pause and quit 

Will be implementing them on my free time.(Which is none. -Exams)

**Thats it!**
